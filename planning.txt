This README is just my quick outline for the program.

1. Program prints instruction to the user.

2. Program calculates a random integer (between 1-1000)
	a. Stores in variable called randomNumber

3. Program asks for user input.

3.5 Start while loop here?

4. Program responds to input. 
	a. If too high, program says the number is too high.
	b. If too low, program says the number is too low.
	c. If user succeeds, program congratulates and then exits.
